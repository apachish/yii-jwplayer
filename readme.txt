Made some small changes to the yii extension by istrone for jwplayer. its a basic bit of script really. the changes make it work better.

***you must get the original JwPlayer extension from yiiframework.com - this github repo only has the main JwPlayer.php. You also need the following files, glow.zip, jwplayer.js, player.swf, preview.jpg, swfobject.js***

get it here http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/jwplayer
